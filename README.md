# _Wallet is a expense manager for building user interfaces_.

   ·Declarative: Wallets make it easy to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your app, and Wallet will efficiently update and render the right components as your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, easier to understand, and easier to debug.

  ·Component Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then structure them to create complex UIs. Because component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state away from the DOM.

  ·Learn Once, Write Anywhere: So you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and run mobile apps using React Native.
You can find the Wallet documentation on the website.

## _Profit one-wallet_:

Transactions Made Easier:
Compared to using coins or paper currency, the transaction process using e-Wallet is relatively faster.
You only need to scan the barcode that has been provided, without having to take out a wallet or physical money to make payments.

·For example, such as payment:

·Shopping

.Food & Beverage

.Water Bill

.Transportation


## _We have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you started:_



```sh
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('container'));
root.render(<HelloMessage name="1Wallet" />);
```
